# AI-Powered Sustainability Management Platform for University Campuses

This project introduces an AI-powered digital platform designed to optimize sustainability management within university campuses, initially piloted at Gebze Technical University (GTU). It aims to overcome the limitations of traditional, manual resource management by integrating data collection, analysis, visualization, and AI-driven forecasting into a comprehensive system.


The platform automates data collection, centralizes information from various departments, and utilizes advanced deep learning models to predict future electricity, natural gas, and water consumption trends, thereby empowering universities to monitor their environmental footprint and make informed decisions towards achieving sustainability goals.



This work aligns with the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goal 11: "Sustainable Cities and Communities," representing a significant step towards data-driven and proactive sustainability management.
